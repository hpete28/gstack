# gstack — AI Engineering Workflow

gstack is a collection of SKILL.md files that give AI agents structured roles for
software development. Each skill is a specialist: CEO reviewer, eng manager,
designer, QA lead, release engineer, debugger, and more.

Use the live skill catalog for routing. For a suite overview, see [docs/agent-skill-catalog.md](docs/agent-skill-catalog.md).

## Build commands

```bash
bun install              # install dependencies
bun test                 # run free tests (no API spend)
bun run test:windows     # curated Windows-safe subset (runs on windows-latest)
bun run build            # generate docs + compile binaries
bun run gen:skill-docs   # regenerate SKILL.md files from templates
bun run skill:check      # health dashboard for all skills
```

## Platform support

- **macOS** + **Linux**: full test suite supported.
- **Windows**: curated Windows-safe subset runs on `windows-latest` via the
  `windows-free-tests` CI job. Setup script (`./setup`) requires Git Bash or
  MSYS today; native PowerShell support is a future expansion. The `bin/gstack-paths`
  helper resolves state roots through `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` / `GSTACK_HOME` so plugin
  installs work on every platform.

## Key conventions

- SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. Edit the template, not the output.
- Run `bun run gen:skill-docs --host codex` to regenerate Codex-specific output.
- The browse binary provides headless browser access. Use `$B <command>` in skills.
- Safety skills (careful, freeze, guard) use inline advisory prose — always confirm before destructive operations.
- State paths resolve via `bin/gstack-paths` (sourced via `eval "$(...)"`). Honors `GSTACK_HOME`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, `CLAUDE_PLANS_DIR`.
- The `claude` CLI binary resolves via `browse/src/claude-bin.ts` (`Bun.which()` + `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN` override). Set `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN=wsl` plus `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN_ARGS='["claude"]'` to run Claude through WSL on Windows.
